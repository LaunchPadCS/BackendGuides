## An introduction to Backend Design

Many programs run directly on a user's device, like apps on a phone or more powerful programs for your laptop. However, sometimes we need to create a program which runs on a `server` instead of a user's machine. great for when we want to create a more complex online service. There's a lot of different ways to approach this, but we're going to cover some of the  basics in these lessons.


### Backend vs Frontend
It's important to clarify the difference between backend and frontend before moving further. A `frontend` application is the code that runs directly on a user's device. A frontend can take many different forms, but the two most common are either a mobile app or a web app. In the case of a web app, the frontend code is the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript which runs directly inside the user's browser. A lot of products will have many different frontends instead of just one-- for example, Facebook has several mobile apps for iOS and Android as well as their main website. All of these would be considered the frontend for Facebook.

The `backend` of an application is the code that runs on a server. The backend accepts requests from the frontend and sends back information. For example, if you open the facebook app running on your phone, it doesn't know what posts it should show you. So it asks the facebook backend to send back information about what posts it should show. The backend gets the request, takes a look at the database, decides what posts should be shown, and then sends back that information.

###How is backend development different?
Building a backend for an app can be pretty different than building a frontend. On the frontend, you're usually pretty restricted on what tools you can use. If you're making a mobile app, you use Java or Swift. If you're making a web application, you're using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. But on the backend, you can write an app using literally whatever you want. There's so many options to pick from that it can sometimes be hard to decide where to get started. We're going to cover one set of tools you can use for backend development, but just know that there's a lot of different options to choose from. Now that you've got through the boring stuff, it's time to move on to the actual programming.

## NodeJS

There's a lot of different tools and languages you can pick from to use for backend development. We're going to cover the  `Node.js` platform, but it's just one of many different ways to build a backend server.


### What is Node.js?
Node.js is a platform that allows JavaScript to run outside the browser as it's own program. It's a relatively new tool, and was released in 2009. Before node, JavaScript was only used inside the browser to manipulate web pages. Although node is useful for a lot of different things, it's mainly used to create backend servers to power web applications.

The [website](https://nodejs.org/en/) will tell you that node uses an "event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient". What this means is that node is good at handling a lot of small tasks at the same time. On the other hand, it's *not* very good at doing big complicated tasks that require a lot of work. Luckily for us, most backends need to handle a lot of small tasks at once, making Node a great choice.

### What are some other options?
Like we said earlier, we're going to focus on Node for these lessons. If you're curios, though, there's a lot of other great options. You can write a backend in almost any language you want, but some languages are specifically built for this type of thing.

`PHP` is one of the oldest and most popular languages to use for building a backend. The vast majority of websites  (over 80%) use php. Although PHP has had some difficulties in the past, it's grown a lot recently and is a very powerful option.

`Ruby on Rails` is a framework that suddenly became incredibly popular around 2008. For a while it was considered the coolest language on the block, and although the hype has died down a lot, it's still a very strong option. Rails allows you to rapidly develop an app using the "convention over configuration" motto.

`Java` is a very popular choice, especially for large companies. Because Java has type-checking, it can safe a lot of hassle when debugging large programs. Java is also relatively fast and can handle a large number of users at once. On top of that, it's been around for a very long time and has a lot of helpful tools/libraries surrounding it.
